    // Tasks for creating the IPad are as follows:
    // Allow the IPad to simulate calling functions - 
    // A way to get the Ipad to look like they can call a person is to create an interface that shows some kind of button that players can press to change 
    // what is seen to a screen that can call a person


    // Allow the Ipad to simulate photo taking functions

    // Start is called before the first frame update

    // Update is called once per frame
